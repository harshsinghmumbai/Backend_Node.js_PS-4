# What is Flash Message ?
<h3>
1.). Flash messages are short, temporary notifications that are used in web applications to give users feedback about their actions or status updates.
</br>
2.). Flash messages are designed to inform users about a specific event or action. They are often used to let users know if an action was successful or if there was an error. </br>
3.). Flash messages appear on the screen briefly and then disappear. This temporary nature helps keep the user interface clean and uncluttered. </br>
4.). Flash messages are commonly used in web development to communicate with users without permanently changing the page's layout or content.
